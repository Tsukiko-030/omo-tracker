# Ideas for OMO Tracker:

## Level 1 Ideas:
* **Stopwatch & Store Hold times in CSV. Store hold number as well.**
* Remove permission system.
* Bring up a history.
* Desperation Scale Integration. With colored fonts.
* Include the user's name maybe over their bladder.
* Add a wiki to the github page, have ther readme contain links to this


## Level 2 Ideas:
* A filling bladder to replace the green bar:
    * Change bar color, make horizontal and move to bottom of screen next to fill text.
    * Put bladder meter front and center.
* Maybe store things like icons etc in other places so the app folder doesn't look like a mess, maybe an intaller is a good idea though that feels like level 3 funtionality.
* Some kind of intro screen with options to input name, estimated bladder size and perhaps prefered dificulty level?
* A scrollable text frame storing all the hold's activities like consumption and leaks maybe some background stuff.

## Level 3 Ideas:
* Allow the user to provide images for different desperation levels.
* Resizable UI
* Installer.
* Chiptune Music.
* Allow choices for how accidents happened.

## Ambiguous Ideas:
* Track leaks to recalculate holding ability.

## General Project management Ideas:
* Document Functions.
* Update the readme.
* section off the code.
* Add a font section
