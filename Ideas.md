# Ideas for OMO Tracker:

## Level 1 Ideas:
* Timer & Store Hold times in CSV.
* Bring up a history.
* Desperation Scale Integration.

## Level 2 Ideas:
* A filling bladder to replace the green bar.
* Maybe store things like icons etc in other places so the app folder doesn't look like a mess, maybe an intaller is a good idea though that feels like level 3 funtionality.


## Level 3 Ideas:
* Allow the user to provide images for different desperation levels.
* Resizable UI
* Installer.
